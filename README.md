📊 1. Basic Charts — Visualizing Data
🟦 Bar Chart:
Used to compare values across categories.
Example: I compared the total number of sales in each region:
North: 1200, South: 950, East: 1100 → Easy to see that North performed the best.

🟡 Pie Chart:
Shows the proportion of parts to a whole.
Example: I displayed course enrollments:

Data Science: 40%

Web Development: 30%

Digital Marketing: 30%
→ A quick snapshot of popularity among courses.

🟩 Histogram:
Shows frequency distribution of numerical data.
Example: I analyzed customer ages in an e-commerce dataset.

Most customers are aged between 25–35
→ Helps identify the primary customer base.

🟪 Box Plot:
Used to identify outliers and data spread.
Example: I examined employee salaries.

Most salaries are between ₹4–6 LPA, but one person earns ₹1 crore (outlier)
→ Useful for spotting unusually high or low values.

🔵 Scatter Plot:
Used to find relationships between two numerical variables.
Example: I plotted ad spend vs revenue.

Higher ad spend usually led to higher revenue
→ Indicates a positive correlation.

🟥 Line Chart:
Used to track changes or trends over time.
Example: I displayed monthly sales for 2023.

Sales peaked in December due to the holiday season
→ Helps forecast future demand.

📈 2. Skewness & Kurtosis — Understanding Distribution
📌 Skewness:
Tells whether data is balanced or tilted to one side.
Example: In a salary dataset:

Most people earned lower salaries, a few earned very high → Right-skewed
(Mean is greater than Median)

📌 Kurtosis:
Measures the “peakedness” of data.
Example: In exam scores:

Most students scored around 75 marks → High kurtosis
(Sharp peak around the average)

✅ These measures help check if data is normally distributed, which is important before applying certain machine learning algorithms.

🔗 3. Correlation Analysis — Finding Relationships
Correlation shows how strongly two variables are related (range: -1 to +1):

📘 Study Hours vs Exam Score:

Strong positive correlation (r ≈ 0.85)

More study hours → higher marks

📕 Shoe Size vs Salary:

Very weak correlation (r ≈ 0.02)

No actual connection

✅ This helps in deciding which features are useful in prediction models.

📚 4. Storytelling with Data (Case Study)
To apply everything practically, I worked on a Retail Sales Dataset where I:

🔹 Created bar and line charts to show regional and monthly performance
🔹 Used histograms to understand customer age distribution
🔹 Applied scatter plots to check ad spend vs sales
🔹 Detected outliers in sales using box plots
🔹 Summarized findings with descriptive stats (mean, median, skewness, etc.)

Insightful Story:
"Sales increased significantly in Q4, mainly driven by younger customers (ages 25–35). High ad spend led to high revenue, especially in North and East regions."

🧠 This hands-on project taught me how to turn raw data into insights and visuals that tell a story — a key skill for data-driven decision-making.

🚀 I’m excited to continue this journey and bridge my Front-End skills with Data Science knowledge to build powerful, insight-driven applications.
